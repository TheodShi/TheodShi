Hello, my name is Theo Shi, and I am a senior programmer with over 20 years of experience. My expertise lies in developing applications on the Microsoft Azure platform, as well as Office 365, SharePoint, and Powerplatform. On the front-end side, I am highly proficient in React, Angular, and Node.js. In addition, I am also well-versed in .NET C# language and have extensive experience with TypeScript.

As a full-stack developer, I have a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, which allows me to build robust and scalable applications. I am always looking to expand my skillset and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Currently, I am very interested in AI and am actively learning and researching OpenAI, Langchian, LLms, Stable Diffusion, and other cutting-edge AI technologies.

I am passionate about coding and enjoy collaborating with other developers to create innovative solutions. I am a quick learner, a problem-solver, and always strive to write clean and maintainable code.
